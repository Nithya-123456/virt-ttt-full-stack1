Hands-on Exercises

1. You are creating a user profile system for a web app. A user's name is stored in a variable. You define the profile using an object, and inside a block, you modify a role field. After the block, you want to confirm the original name is still used and the updated role is reflected.
Write a program to implement this logic and explain how the role update works while the name remains unchanged.

2.Implement a user account system where each user has a private password field. Allow setting and validating password only through methods. Extend this to an admin user that can reset passwords for other users.

3. You have an array of student objects, each with a name, and optionally a grades array (might be missing). Write a program that:
•	Uses arrow functions to process students.
•	Calculates the average grade for each student who has grades.
•	Returns an array of messages like:
"Student [name] has an average grade of [avg]"
•	If a student has no grades or grades is missing, safely handle it using optional chaining and return:
"Student [name] has no grades."

4.You have an array of people objects, each with a name and a birthdate string (format: "YYYY-MM-DD"). Write a program that:
•	Converts the birthdate string to a Date object.
•	Checks who has a birthday today (match day and month).
•	Returns a message:
"Today is [name]'s birthday!"
•	If no birthdays today, return "No birthdays today."

5. You have two user profile objects:
const user1 = { name: "Madam", age: 30, city: "Chennai" };
const user2 = { age: 31, profession: "Developer", country: "India" };
Write a program that:
•	Merges both user objects into one, with properties from user2 overriding those from user1 if conflicts exist.
•	Uses destructuring to extract name, age, and the rest of the properties separately.
•	Prints the extracted values clearly.

6. You have a module that exports a Movie class. The class stores movie details (title, director, year). Write a program that:
•	Imports the Movie class.
•	Uses a function fetchMovieDetails(id) that returns a Promise resolving after 2 seconds with a movie object.
•	Uses destructuring and spread/rest operators in the process.
•	Prints a formatted message about the movie using template literals.
•	Use let and const appropriately and arrow functions where possible.

7. You are building a system where users have a list of roles. Certain roles grant access to admin panels. You also want to calculate a user’s "power score" as 2 raised to the number of roles they have.
Write a program that:
•	Checks if the user has any of the privileged roles (["admin", "moderator", "superuser"]) using a proper array method.
•	Calculates their power score using exponentiation based on the number of roles.
•	Prints a message like:
"Access Granted. Power Score: [score]"
 or
"Access Denied. Power Score: [score]"

8. You have an object where keys are usernames and values are their scores. Write an async function that:
•	Simulates fetching this data after 2 seconds.
•	Uses Object.entries() to loop through the username-score pairs.
•	Pads each username to 15 characters (right) and score to 5 digits (left).
•	Logs the leaderboard in a clean, aligned format.

9. Imagine you are receiving user data from an async generator which yields user objects. Each user has an email field. You need to:
•	Extract the domain from each email using a regular expression with named groups.
•	Store all unique domains using a Set.
•	Use for-await-of to handle the incoming stream.
•	Use Promise.finally() to print “Stream completed” at the end, even if errors occur.

10. You are given student data from multiple CSV lines. Each line is an array of strings, where:
•	First value is the student name (sometimes padded with extra spaces).
•	Remaining values are course names (some arrays are nested).
•	You must: 
o	Trim name values.
o	Flatten all course arrays.
o	Group them by student using Object.fromEntries().
o	Handle errors using optional catch binding.
